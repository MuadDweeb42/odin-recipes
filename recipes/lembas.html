        <ul>
            Ingredients
            <li>1 1/2 stick butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 c brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 c honey</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 T orange blossom water</li>
            <li>2 c AP flour</li>
            <li>1/2 c almond meal</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/3 c sliced almonds</li>
            <li>6 banana leaves (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            Instructions
            <li>Preheat oven to 375F</li>
            <li>Cream together the softened butter, sugar, and honey.</li>
            <li>Add the orange blossom water, vanilla, and lemon zest. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Add one egg at a time and scrape the batter down between additions.</li>
            <li>Add flour and almond meal in two to three additions. Scrape between each addition.</li>
            <li>Add almond slices and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic. Keep it 1/2" thick and square to make it easier to cut later.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once firm, cut into 2" by 3" rectangles. Cut banana leaves to fit.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a baking sheet. Arrange lembas on pan - they can be kept fairly close together because they won't spread as they bake.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes. Lembas should be firm and light golden in color. Cool before wrapping.</li>
        </ol>
